LGPL sprintf implementation

Sprintf is licensed under the LGPL v2. A copy of that
license is included here.

This library was included at the last minute because the license on some
other software used in the Actel port of opENer stipulates that it
cannot be combined with viral-licensed (GPL) software. The sprintf I was
using was derived from Linux's printk, so I had to real quick find
something else.

The original source (printf-stdarg.c) was downloaded from:
http://www.menie.org/georges/embedded/index.html


Thanks to Georges Menie and Christian Ettinger.

http://mirror.fsf.org/pmon2000/2.x/src/lib/libc/scanf.c
